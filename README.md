# 🚀 End-to-End DevOps Automation Web Application

This project demonstrates a complete DevOps workflow implementing Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), ChatOps notifications, and static website hosting using modern cloud-based tools.

The objective is to automate the build, testing, deployment, and communication processes for a frontend web application, simulating a real-world DevOps environment.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design and implement an automated DevOps pipeline that:

- Automatically builds code on every commit
- Notifies team members about build status
- Deploys the website automatically to cloud hosting
- Eliminates manual deployment errors
- Enables faster and efficient collaboration

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Version Control | Git, GitHub |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| ChatOps | Slack Incoming Webhook |
| Deployment | Netlify |
| Frontend | HTML |
| Editor | VS Code |

## ⚙ DevOps Workflow

The automated workflow follows this process:

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions CI pipeline triggers automatically
3. Build and test steps execute
4. Slack notification sent (success / failure)
5. Netlify automatically deploys updated website
6. Live website updated globally via CDN

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline Features

✔ Automatic trigger on every push to main branch  
✔ Code checkout and build simulation  
✔ Test simulation execution  
✔ Build logs generation  
✔ Real-time status tracking  

---

## 💬 ChatOps Integration

Slack notifications are sent automatically when:

- Build succeeds
- Build fails

This helps developers monitor deployments in real time and improves team collaboration.
